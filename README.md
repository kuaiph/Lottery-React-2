# Lottery-React

# Function :

Lottery app that registers a manager, players, and funds to be contributed and won.

Built with MetaMask, the Rinkeby test network, Remix and Infura.

The smart contract logic resides in Lottery.sol (https://github.com/prateeksawhney97/Lottery-Smart-Contract-Ethereum) and this repository contains the front-end page built with create-react-app.

# How it works :

To take part in the lottery every user needs to send some amount of money(which cannot be less than 0.01 ETH for each user). After some people have entered the contract a "third-party"(manager of the contract) will tell the contract to pick a winner, beware that he does not pick the winner itself, the contract does that. After it picks the winner, the contract sends him the full price and resets; to continue for other players that want to play.
